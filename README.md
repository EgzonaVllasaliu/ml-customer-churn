# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to analyze the Telco Customer Churn dataset to understand customer churn patterns, identify important features, and predict customer churn using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains customer demographics, usage patterns, and transaction history.

## Dataset

The dataset is obtained from Kaggle's Telco Customer Churn dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.

### Features

The dataset contains the following features:

1. CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
2. Gender: Customer's gender (Male, Female)
3. SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not (1, 0)
4. Partner: Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No)
5. Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No)
6. Tenure: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company
7. PhoneService: Whether the customer has a phone service or not (Yes, No)
8. MultipleLines: Whether the customer has multiple lines or not (Yes, No, No phone service)
9. InternetService: Customer’s internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, No)
10. OnlineSecurity: Whether the customer has online security or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
11. OnlineBackup: Whether the customer has online backup or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
12. DeviceProtection: Whether the customer has device protection or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
13. TechSupport: Whether the customer has tech support or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
14. StreamingTV: Whether the customer has streaming TV or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
15. StreamingMovies: Whether the customer has streaming movies or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
16. Contract: The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
17. PaperlessBilling: Whether the customer has paperless billing or not (Yes, No)
18. PaymentMethod: The customer’s payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic))
19. MonthlyCharges: The amount charged to the customer monthly
20. TotalCharges: The total amount charged to the customer
21. Churn: Whether the customer churned or not (Yes, No)

## Data Analysis

The data analysis process includes data exploration, visualization, and preprocessing to understand the dataset and identify important features.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

Several algorithms can be used to predict customer churn. Some possible algorithms to consider:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forest
5. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
6. XGBoost
7. Neural Networks

## Model Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the different algorithms, we can use metrics such as:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1-score
5. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)

## Getting Started

Based on the dataset, we can identify some features that might not be very useful for the prediction of customer churn:
CustomerID: This is a unique identifier for each customer and doesn't carry any meaningful information for churn prediction.
As for the other features, they all seem to have some potential in helping to predict customer churn. However, during the data analysis and preprocessing phase, we should further explore the relationships between these features and customer churn to identify any multicollinearity or irrelevant features.

Regarding the best algorithm for this example, it's difficult to say without actually testing them on the dataset. However, some insights into why certain algorithms might be better suited for this problem:

Logistic Regression: It's a simple algorithm that can work well with binary classification problems like customer churn. It can also help identify the importance of each feature.
Random Forest: This ensemble method often performs well in various classification tasks. It can handle a mix of categorical and continuous features, which is the case in this dataset.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and XGBoost: These algorithms are known for their high performance in classification tasks. They can handle a mix of categorical and continuous features and automatically deal with missing data.
Neural Networks: With proper feature scaling and architecture, neural networks can be effective in handling complex relationships between features and the target variable.
